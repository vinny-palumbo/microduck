"""The same session over the robot's own signalling server, for a consumer already on the LAN.

The rendezvous path is the one that reaches a duck from anywhere, and it leans on a relay
candidate to do it: between a home router and a data centre, srflx-to-srflx punches often enough
to be worth trying and not often enough to rely on, so the fallback carries the session
(`docs/design/remote-access-design.md` §6). On the duck's own network none of that is needed —
both sides offer host candidates and ICE pairs them immediately — and a driving session is
exactly the kind that should not be paying a relay's latency to reach a robot two metres away.

**This is a transport, not a second design.** `webrtcsink`'s signalling server is already running
on the robot at `ws://<robot>:8443`, and it carries the same gst envelopes the rendezvous carries
over SSE and `POST /send` — §3.2 has the two sides side by side. So everything above the session is
untouched: the same `control` channel, the same JSON-RPC, the same `Rpc` object. What changes is
one hop, and it changes in the direction of *fewer* moving parts: no account, no lease, no
rendezvous, no relay.

Which makes it the thing to reach for when a click does not work over the rendezvous and nobody
knows which layer to blame. If it works here and not there, the transport is the problem and
nothing about the policy, the manifest or the robot is.

What is deliberately absent is a reconnect loop. Their consumer has one because a robot on the far
side of the internet goes away for reasons nobody can see; a robot on this desk that stops
answering is worth a sentence on the page rather than a silent retry every five seconds.
